# Aidan Simpson - Front-end Developer

Hello!

I am a developer who has built websites and worked with professional Agencies for the past seven years.
On my personal website - <a href="https://www.aidansimpson.com/" target="blank">aidansimpson.com</a> - I have links to the projects where I played a major role in developing and contributing to, though there are so many more not listed! While my profile here may look to be missing code, from the years of working full-time I have used different company-owned accounts. Due to privacy reasons, I am also unable to showcase most of my work.

My skills are focused more towards front-end development, though I have also played roles as a Project Manager, assistant Designer, and a Back-end developer for periods of time.

About Me:
- With Docker as a base, I have alternated between DDEV or Lando for my local environment.
- I use Visual Studio Code for the most part as my 'IDE' (plus various extensions), though also enjoy using Sublime Text for simplicity/better focus.
- MacOS is my primary workstation, though have used Ubuntu as well.
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript or jQuery / PHP are my core languages, though use different compilers and such as needed.
